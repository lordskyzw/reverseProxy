create vectors from the information in the resources folder
upsert those vectors to the pinecone index
implement semantic search in the search tab

OR research how semantic searches are implemented first (LITERATURE REVIEW LOL)


so the app itself shall be a single search page
while a user searches, matching results shall be displayed
when the user clicks for the resource, they shall be ran through the app's logic
or when they finish and continue searching, semantic results will be returned and when they try to access the resource, they shall be ran through the app's logic!
